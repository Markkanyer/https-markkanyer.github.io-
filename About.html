    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="about-wrapper">
      <div class="about-text">
        <p>My name is <strong><em>George</em> Mark Kanyer</strong>, and I am a passionate marketing strategist and data analyst based in   Seattle, Washington. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing and a minor in Business Data Analytics from the University of Washington Tacoma. And I started my <strong>Master of Science in Business Analytics</strong> (MSBA) at UW Tacoma in June 2025.</p>
        <p>I’ve developed a strong foundation in digital marketing, communications, and data storytelling through a variety of internships and roles. These experiences have allowed me to create compelling content, manage social media strategies, and support event marketing for both educational and community organizations.</p>
        <p>Whether it’s crafting engaging campaigns, analyzing performance metrics, or streamlining communications, I thrive in roles that blend creativity and analytics. I’m especially drawn to projects that aim to make an impact by helping brands communicate better, people connect more easily, and communities grow stronger through digital presence.</p>
        <p>When I’m not working or studying, I enjoy traveling across the US, spending time with friends and family, gaming, and spending time in nature swimming/jogging around the beautiful Pacific Northwest area.</p>
        <p>This website serves as a digital portfolio to showcase my journey, highlight projects I’ve worked on, and provide a way to connect. Thank you for visiting, feel free to check out my experience and get in touch!</p>
